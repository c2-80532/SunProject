	In the Home Directory, Create a Directory name as Project
	Initiate the Project directory as a Git Directory
Inside the GitHub -> Create a (Public) Repository named as SunProject
(Which will be considered as a web project)

Setup the webhook to send the notification to Jenkins Machine
Inside the AWS.
	1. Jenkins Machine (Install Docker on the same machine)
			This machine will help us to setup the CI/CD pipeline
			Project Build - Webhook (push event)
			Create a Container -> DockerHub
	2. Deployment Server ( Deploy the container on this server)
If the Build is failed in the jenkins, it should initiate the mail notification.

Result
When you use the push command in the virtual machine, it should update the Website without any other interaction.
