Take a Debian Machine in Virtual Box
	Keep the Username - sunbeam
			 Password - sunbeam			 Update the packages
	Create a Snapshot of Fresh Machine.

	In the Home Directory, Create a Directory name as Project
	Initiate the Project directory as a Git Directory
	
Inside the GitHub -> Create a (Private) Repository named as SunProject
(Which will be considered as a web project)
Setup the webhook to send the notification to Jenkins Machine
Inside the AWS. (Create a VPC)
	1. Jenkins Machine
			This machine will help us to setup the CI/CD pipeline
			Project Build - Webhook (push event)
	2. Docker
			This machine will generate the container -> dockerhub
	3. Web Environment
			1. Dockerswarm
			2. Node1
			3. node2
			(Container will be deployed using dockerswarm and 2 other nodes (replicas - 3) for high availability and load balancing)
	4. Database Server (This will hold the database of the Webserver)

If the Build is failed in the jenkins, it should initiate the mail notification.

Notes:- You have to build a small web application with login Page and store the data of the authentication inside the database server. And for that database connectivity will be required.

Result
When you use the push command in the virtual machine, it should update the Website without any other interaction.	
Database Handling will be manual
